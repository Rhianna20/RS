Two weeks into my placement and I've learnt about MakeFiles, .gitignore, front matter, toml, and finally built my blog! I began placement excited and curious, I was wondering throughout the christmas holidays I never knew what sort of tickets Iâ€™d work on being in the Reliability and engineering team. I am only 2 weeks in I have a good feeling and beyond excited as my journey continues.

First week at FT:
- Was introduced to the whole team via google meets
- Email introduction to the whole of FT!
- Setting up my computer took me 3 days
- was introduced to FT systems and software
- broke some code trying to figure out how it works
- Was introduced to front matter.
- Got my first ticket which was to not allow draft pages to be displayed to users
- ended the week making my first pr!

Bootcamp  helped prepare me with communicating with new people via message  or video call at work, which is something I struggled with throughout bootcamp. Many times I found myself overthinking a question so much that I put myself off of asking the person  which led to me spending hours trying to do something I did not understand.  Communicating your issues and how someone can help be the solution is a skill.
